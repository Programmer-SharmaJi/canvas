## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer or use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```
### Docker Commands

```
1) BUILD IMAGE : docker build -t developerfolio:latest .
2) RUN IMAGE: docker run -t -p 3000:3000 developerfolio:latest
```


## How To Use 

From your command line, clone and run developerFolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone Link
# Go into the repository
cd Folder

# Setup default environment variables

# For Linux
cp env.example .env
# For Windows
copy env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start a local dev server
npm start
```

## Linking Portfolio to GitHub

1. Create a file called .env in the root directory of your project 

Note: Configuring environment variables before deploying your portfolio is highly recommended as some components depend on API data. 

```bash
- DeveloperFolio
  - node_modules
  - public
  - src
  - .env         <-- create it here
  - env.example  <-- this is the base file
  - .gitignore
  - package-lock.json
  - package.json
```

2. Inside the .env file, add key `REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN` and assign your GitHub token like this, also add your username as `GITHUB_USERNAME`

```env
// .env
REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN = "YOUR GITHUB TOKEN HERE"
GITHUB_USERNAME = "YOUR GITHUB USERNAME"
USE_GITHUB_DATA = "true"
```

Set `showGithubProfile` to true or false to show Contact Profile using GitHub, defaults to false.

## Linking blogs section to Medium

Optionally, you can link the blogs section to your medium user account:

* Inside the .env file, add key `MEDIUM_USERNAME` and assign your Medium username

```env
// .env
MEDIUM_USERNAME = "YOUR MEDIUM USERNAME"
```

* For Github Action, change the environment variable `MEDIUM_USERNAME` in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

Set `displayMediumBlogs` to true or false in portofolio.js to display fetched Medium blogs, defaults to true.

## Change and customize every section according to your need.

#### Using Emojis

For adding emoji 😃 into the texts in `Portfolio.js`, use the `emoji()` function and pass the text you need as an argument. This would help in keeping emojis compatible across different browsers and platforms.

#### Customize Lottie Animations

You can choose a Lottie and download it in json In `src/assets/lottie`, replace the Lottie json file you want to alter with the same file name. If you want to change the Lottie options, go to `src/components/displayLottie/DisplayLottie.js` and change the `defaultOptions` object, you can refer [lottie-react docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-react) for more info on the `defaultOptions` object.

#### Adding Twitter Time line to your Page
Insert your Twitter username in `portfolio.js` to show your recent activity on your page.

```javascript
const twitterDetails = {
  userName : "Your Twitter Username"
};
```
Note: Don't use `@` symbol when adding username.

## Deployment
When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.

#### Configuring GitHub Actions (Recommended)
First you should enable, GitHub Actions for the repository you use.
